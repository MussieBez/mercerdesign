          Welcome to The Mercer Club! This Terms of Service agreement (“Terms”) is between you (“you” or “your”) and The
          Mercer Club, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “The Mercer Club”), and governs your access to and use of our website
          located at&nbsp;&nbsp;themercerclubnyc.com (and any successor site thereto) (the “Site”), our mobile
          application (the “App”) and related services, including The Mercer Club’s product rental and sale services
          (together with the Site, the App, and the Content (as defined below), the “Services”). These Terms also apply
          to in-store and hotel rentals and sales, which are part of the Services.<br />Please review these Terms
          carefully; by accessing or using any of the Services, including by creating an Account (as defined below), you
          acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms.<br />These Terms are a
          legally binding contract between you and The Mercer Club. By accepting these Terms, you represent that you are
          an individual of legal age to form a binding contract or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or
          guardian consent to enter into these Terms. Under no circumstances may you access or use the Services if you
          are under thirteen (13) years old. Your access to and use of the Services in any way also means that you agree
          to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you access or use the Services. These Terms
          incorporate by reference any additional terms and conditions posted by The Mercer Club through the Site and/or
          the App, or otherwise made available to you by The Mercer Club (the “Additional Terms”), and you understand
          and agree that by accessing or using any of our Services, you agree to also comply with all Additional
          Terms.<br />EXCEPT FOR LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN SUBCLAUSE (c) OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BELOW,
          YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE
          YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR TO A TRIAL BY JURY.<br />The
          Services are controlled or operated (or both) from the United States, and are not intended to subject The
          Mercer Club to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. You may not use the Services to rent or purchase Products
          outside of the United States. Any use of the Site is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable
          laws, rules, and regulations in doing so. We may limit the Service’s availability at any time, in whole or in
          part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.

        <div class="we-may-at-any-t-ferings-similar-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          We may, at any time and without liability, suspend, modify, or discontinue all or part of the Services
          (including access to the Site via any third-party links). We encourage you to check our Site periodically for
          the most current Service offerings. Similarly, we may update the Content, including descriptions and
          specifications about Products or Services, and we reserve the right to remove any Content (as described below)
          at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed Content in
          violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. The Mercer Club will have no liability
          for any change in the Services, or any suspension or termination of your access to Services.<br />We also
          reserve the right to change these Terms at any time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means,
          including by posting the revised Terms on the Site. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when these Terms
          were last changed. At our discretion, we may also notify you of certain changes by sending you an email to the
          email address associated with your Account. You are responsible for providing us with your current email
          address when you create an Account, and, if your email address changes, for updating your Account information
          to reflect your new email address. Your continued use of the Services, including by renting or purchasing
          Products (as defined below) from us, following any changes to these Terms will indicate your acknowledgement
          of such changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms. Any changes to the Terms will not apply to any
          dispute between you and us that arises prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms incorporating
          such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you may no

          required to sign up for an account (your “Account”), select a password and username (your “The Mercer Club

          provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information, and to maintain and update such information.
          You may not select as your The Mercer Club User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another
          person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. We may reject, or require that you change, any The
          Mercer Club User ID, password or other information that you provide to us in registering for an Account. You
          may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You may only register one
          Account per Paid Service (as defined below).<br />Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or
          features of the Services by using your account credentials from other services operated by third parties
          (each, a “Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Google and Facebook. By using the Services through a
          Third Party Account, you authorize us to access information from such Third Party Account for use in
          connection with the Services. <br />You may only use the Services and Products made available to you for your
          own personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a
          manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services or Products is prohibited by
          these Terms or any Additional Terms or applicable laws, then you are not authorized to use the Services or
          Products. You are solely responsible for any use by you of any Services or Products in violation of these
          Terms, any Additional Terms, or applicable law.<br />You may not share your Account (including your The Mercer
          Club User ID or password) with anyone, and you must protect the security of your Account (including your The
          Mercer Club User ID and password) and any other access tools or credentials. You’re solely responsible for any
          activity associated with your Account, including all charges incurred from use of the Services with your
          Account.<br />We may, for any reason, limit or restrict your access to or use of the Services, including, but
          not limited to, refusing to fulfill any order that you place with us or restricting orders placed under a
          single customer Account, payment card, or billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit, cancel,
          or prohibit any use of the Services for any reason in our sole discretion, including but not limited to
          availability and geographic concerns, or if we determine or suspect that you are using the Services for
          fraudulent or commercial purposes or for any other purposes in violation of these Terms or any Additional
          Terms.

        <div class="you-agree-to-tr-stains-or-any-o-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          You agree to treat the Products with great care. You are responsible for any loss, destruction, or damage to
          the Products for any reason (other than normal wear and tear), including due to theft, loss, mysterious
          disappearance, fire, major stains, or any other cause. Normal wear and tear means minor stains, rips, missing
          beads, stuck zippers, or other minor damage that is covered by the insurance you paid for with your rental of
          the applicable Product. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you hereby
          authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your Payment Method for the price for repairing
          or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion, up to the full Retail Value for the Product.

        <div class="we-may-but-are-xt-billing-date-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          We may, but are not obligated to, permit you to put your Membership Service on hold for one or more Billing
          Periods (a “Pause”). If you wish to Pause your Membership Service, you must return each Product still in your
          possession by your next Billing Date, in accordance with these Terms, for the Pause to go into effect. If you
          do not return each Product in your possession prior to your next Billing Date, your Membership Service will
          not be Paused and you will continue to be charged for the Membership Service. Once Paused, we will provide
          notice to you on or before the date that your Membership Service reactivates. You can reactivate your
          Membership Service during a Pause at any time prior to the set date of reactivation, and that the date on
          which you manually reactivate your Membership Service will become your new Billing Date. Please see
          our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section for more information regarding Pauses (including how to initiate a Pause or
          reactivate your Membership Service).

          Payment Method is valid and up-to-date. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and

          effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize
          us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen Payment Method. You agree to make payment using that
          selected Payment Method, but if the Payment Processor is not able to charge your preferred Payment Method, you

          If you choose a Membership Service, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current applicable rate

          around the last day of that month). The period between your Billing Dates is referred to as a “Billing
          Period.” As of your first Billing Date, the Membership Services are available to you, subject to these Terms.
          Your Account will remain active and you will remain eligible to participate in the Membership Services for
          subsequent Billing Periods after we successfully receive your payment for each applicable Billing Date. If you
          do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must Cancel or Pause the applicable
          Membership Service or terminate your Account before the end of the then-current Billing Period.<br />By
          choosing a recurring Membership Service, you acknowledge that such Paid Services have an initial and recurring
          payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT
          PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE

          In addition to your agreement with the foregoing terms and conditions, and notwithstanding anything to the
          contrary herein, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any version of the App compatible
          with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc. (“Apple”). Apple is not a party to these Terms and does not own
          and is not responsible for the App. Apple is not providing any warranty for the App except, if applicable, to
          refund the purchase price for it. Apple is not responsible for maintenance or other support services for the
          App and shall not be responsible for any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses with
          respect to the App, including any third-party product liability claims, claims that the App fails to conform
          to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar
          legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints
          relating to the use of the App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed
          to The Mercer Club in accordance with the “Information or Complaints” section below. The license you have been
          granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on an Apple-branded product that runs
          Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the usage rules
          set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any

          • Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to
          settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these
          Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating
          arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, such dispute shall be finally settled by binding
          arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will proceed in the English
          language, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as
          amended by this Arbitration Agreement (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
          substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The Consumer
          Arbitration Rules are available online
          at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web_FINAL_2.pdf. The arbitrator will
          conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless
          the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person
          appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration
          of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
          location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will
          follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
          temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this
          Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the
          arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from
          bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek
          relief against us for you. <br />• Class Action Waiver. You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will
          take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing
          to give up the ability to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
          Arbitration Agreement or any other provision of these Terms or in the American Arbitration Association’s
          Consumer Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the foregoing
          class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
          In any case in which (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (ii) there
          is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the
          class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of
          competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in
          arbitration.<br />• Small Claims Court; Infringement. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to resolve
          disputes using arbitration, both you and The Mercer Club may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims
          court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, both you
          and The Mercer Club will have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any
          court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
          violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
          rights.<br />• Waiver of Jury Trial. You and The Mercer Club are each waiving the right to trial by a jury and
          instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Except for disputes that qualify for
          small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship
          between you and The Mercer Club, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any
          other legal theory, will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided above
          regarding the class action waiver, such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or
          relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability,
          revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such
          matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set forth above, the
          preceding arbitration requirement shall not apply to disputes to the extent relating to the interpretation or
          application of the class action waiver above, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity. <br />•
          Exclusive Venue. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits either you or The
          Mercer Club to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court,
          then the foregoing Arbitration Agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and The Mercer Club
          agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal
          courts located in New York County, New York.<br />• Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and
          other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the
          preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This Arbitration Agreement
          will survive the termination of your relationship with The Mercer Club.

          Welcome to The Mercer Club! This Terms of Service agreement (“Terms”) is between you (“you” or “your”) and The
          Mercer Club, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “The Mercer Club”), and governs your access to and use of our website
          located at&nbsp;&nbsp;themercerclubnyc.com (and any successor site thereto) (the “Site”), our mobile
          application (the “App”) and related services, including The Mercer Club’s product rental and sale services
          (together with the Site, the App, and the Content (as defined below), the “Services”). These Terms also apply
          to in-store and hotel rentals and sales, which are part of the Services.<br />Please review these Terms
          carefully; by accessing or using any of the Services, including by creating an Account (as defined below), you
          acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms.<br />These Terms are a
          legally binding contract between you and The Mercer Club. By accepting these Terms, you represent that you are
          an individual of legal age to form a binding contract or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or
          guardian consent to enter into these Terms. Under no circumstances may you access or use the Services if you
          are under thirteen (13) years old. Your access to and use of the Services in any way also means that you agree
          to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you access or use the Services. These Terms
          incorporate by reference any additional terms and conditions posted by The Mercer Club through the Site and/or
          the App, or otherwise made available to you by The Mercer Club (the “Additional Terms”), and you understand
          and agree that by accessing or using any of our Services, you agree to also comply with all Additional
          Terms.<br />EXCEPT FOR LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN SUBCLAUSE (c) OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BELOW,
          YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE
          YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR TO A TRIAL BY JURY.<br />The
          Services are controlled or operated (or both) from the United States, and are not intended to subject The
          Mercer Club to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. You may not use the Services to rent or purchase Products
          outside of the United States. Any use of the Site is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable
          laws, rules, and regulations in doing so. We may limit the Service’s availability at any time, in whole or in
          part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.
        </div>
        <div class="as-noted-above-with-certain-i-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          As noted above, you must be 13 years or older to access or use the Services. To use the Services, you may be
          required to sign up for an account (your “Account”), select a password and username (your “The Mercer Club
          User ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your contact information. You promise to
          provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information, and to maintain and update such information.
          You may not select as your The Mercer Club User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another
          person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. We may reject, or require that you change, any The
          Mercer Club User ID, password or other information that you provide to us in registering for an Account. You
          may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You may only register one
          Account per Paid Service (as defined below).<br />Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or
          features of the Services by using your account credentials from other services operated by third parties
          (each, a “Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Google and Facebook. By using the Services through a
          Third Party Account, you authorize us to access information from such Third Party Account for use in
          connection with the Services. <br />You may only use the Services and Products made available to you for your
          own personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a
          manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services or Products is prohibited by
          these Terms or any Additional Terms or applicable laws, then you are not authorized to use the Services or
          Products. You are solely responsible for any use by you of any Services or Products in violation of these
          Terms, any Additional Terms, or applicable law.<br />You may not share your Account (including your The Mercer
          Club User ID or password) with anyone, and you must protect the security of your Account (including your The
          Mercer Club User ID and password) and any other access tools or credentials. You’re solely responsible for any
          activity associated with your Account, including all charges incurred from use of the Services with your
          Account.<br />We may, for any reason, limit or restrict your access to or use of the Services, including, but
          not limited to, refusing to fulfill any order that you place with us or restricting orders placed under a
          single customer Account, payment card, or billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit, cancel,
          or prohibit any use of the Services for any reason in our sole discretion, including but not limited to
          availability and geographic concerns, or if we determine or suspect that you are using the Services for
          fraudulent or commercial purposes or for any other purposes in violation of these Terms or any Additional
          Terms.
        </div>
        <div class="you-agree-to-tr-stains-or-any-o-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          You agree to treat the Products with great care. You are responsible for any loss, destruction, or damage to
          the Products for any reason (other than normal wear and tear), including due to theft, loss, mysterious
          disappearance, fire, major stains, or any other cause. Normal wear and tear means minor stains, rips, missing
          beads, stuck zippers, or other minor damage that is covered by the insurance you paid for with your rental of
          the applicable Product. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you hereby
          authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your Payment Method for the price for repairing
          or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion, up to the full Retail Value for the Product.
        </div>
        <div class="you-must-provid-ccount-up-to-da-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          You must provide us with accurate shipping information, so that we can timely deliver Products to you. You are
          responsible for providing us with accurate shipping information for deliveries and for keeping the shipping
          information for your Account up-to-date. If you provide us with a shipping address that is invalid or where
          you cannot securely accept Products upon delivery, or if you do not keep your shipping information up-to-date,
          you are solely responsible for any resulting loss, theft, or damage to the Products. Following delivery to the
          designated address, as between you and us, you will be solely responsible for the condition of each Product
          until you return such Product (including while they are in transit). We reserve the right to reject, cancel,
          or prohibit any rentals or sales of Products for any reason. Please see our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section for more
          information regarding deliveries.
        </div>
        <div class="you-agree-to-re-ct-including-by-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          You agree to return each rented Product to The Mercer Club on or before the return date for the Product
          identified in the applicable online invoice for your order. We may, but are not required to, permit you to
          extend your order for a Product (including by contacting us), subject to pre-payment of any additional fees
          applicable to that Product for the period of time of the extension. We are not responsible for any personal or
          other items left in the Products or which are returned to The Mercer Club in the Return Packaging. If you
          believe you have accidentally or otherwise sent any such items to us, please contact customer service as soon
          as possible at support@themercerclubnyc.com. We may, but are not required to, assist you in attempting to
          locate such items at your request, and we assume no responsibility or liability if we attempt to locate such
          items.<br />If you use the Return Packaging that we provide, you must use the shipping carrier specified on
          the pre-paid shipping label included with the Return Packaging. The Mercer Club will not be responsible for
          loss, theft, or damage to Products that are shipped back to us using any carrier other than the carrier that
          is specified on our Return Packaging, or for any fees or expenses that you incur due to delays in The Mercer
          Club receiving the Product. The Mercer Club does not ship Products outside of the United States, and you may
          not return Products to us from outside of the United States without our prior written permission.<br />In the
          event that you lose or damage the Return Packaging that we provide, you will be responsible for returning the
          Product to us in your own packaging, at your own expense. Furthermore, you acknowledge that using any
          packaging or shipping carriers other than our Return Packaging and the carrier specified thereon may result in
          delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which The Mercer Club will not be liable. You will be solely
          liable for all such delays and additional delivery fees.<br />If you are returning a Product using our
          self-service kiosks, once a Product has been scanned into a kiosk return scanner, it is considered a Product
          return and you must immediately deposit the Product in the return bin provided. Failure to deposit a Product
          in the return bin at the self-service kiosk at the time that it is scanned into the kiosk is a violation of
          our Terms, and we may terminate your Account, charge your Payment Method for the full Value of the Product,
          and/or take other legal action.<br />For more information regarding Product returns, please refer to
          our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section for the most up-to-date information.

        <div class="we-may-in-our-s-are-accurate-co-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          We may, in our sole discretion, provide listings, descriptions, or images of Products that are available on
          the Services, as well as references and links to Products, but we do not warrant that the Product listings,
          descriptions, or images are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free, or that any Products will be
          available, even if noted as so on our Services. Such information and the availability of any Product are
          subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures, and similar descriptions are
          approximate and are for convenience only. We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of
          Products, including the applicable colors, however the actual colors you see will depend on your computer
          system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer (including a smart phone or similar device) will accurately
          display such colors. The prices displayed for Products and Services are quoted in U.S. dollars, unless
          otherwise indicated. Prices and availability for Products on our Reserve Service are not confirmed until the
          applicable Products are shipped; if the actual price of such a Product is higher than our stated price, or if
          the Product is no longer available, we will contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order
          and notify you of such cancellation. The availability through the Services of any listing, description, or
          image of a Product does not imply our endorsement of such Product or affiliation with the provider of such
          Product.

        <div class="we-may-charge-y-rvices-that-you-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          We may charge you to access and use certain parts of the Services (the “Paid Services”). We reserve the right
          to modify or waive fees required to use certain parts of the Services. You are solely responsible for: (i) the
          fee for any Paid Services that you order and that are not cancelled in accordance with our cancellation
          policy, (ii) the price of any Products that are not returned in accordance with our policies, and (iii) any
          late fees accrued by you due to late or lost items. <br />For more information about our Services, including
          pricing and fees and cancellation policies, please see our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section. Please note that any
          payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of
          these Terms.

        <div class="if-you-rent-a-p-erves-the-right-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          If you rent a Product through our Reserve Service, the rental fee (“Rental Fee”) will include insurance
          charges and delivery charges (as applicable) listed on the Reserve Service for your rental of the applicable
          Product. The Mercer Club reserves the right to alter the Rental Fee or availability of any particular item at
          its discretion and without notice.
        </div>
        <div class="if-you-purchase-such-membershi-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          If you purchase a Membership Service, the subscription fee (“Subscription Fee”) will be the then-current
          applicable subscription rate (including all applicable taxes and fees) listed on the Membership Service on the
          date that you sign up for such Membership Service; provided that, if your Membership Service is based on a
          promotional rate, you will be charged a fee equal to the promotional rate for the duration of the promotion,
          and, after the expiration of the applicable promotion, you will be charged the applicable rate on a recurring
          monthly basis. For information on the applicable fees, including any applicable discounts and insurance
          charges listed during the check-out process, please see the “ Plans” section of our Site. The Mercer Club
          reserves the right to alter the Subscription Fee or availability of any particular item at its discretion and
          without notice.
        </div>
        <div class="if-you-purchase-cer-club-at-its-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          If you purchase a Product through the Services, the purchase price for such Product (“Purchase Price”) will be
          equal to the purchase fee and delivery charges listed on the Service for the applicable Product at the time of
          purchase. The Mercer Club, at its discretion and without notice, reserves the right to alter the price of a
          Product, the amount or availability of any discount, or the availability of any particular item. You hereby
          authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your Payment Method (as defined below) for the
          Purchase Price when you purchase Products. We will charge your Payment Method the amount of the Purchase Price
          immediately upon your purchase order. We do not make, and expressly disclaim, any warranties of any kind with
          respect to any Product that you purchase, and such Product is provided on an “AS IS” basis.
        </div>
        <div class="if-you-do-not-r-hipping-and-los-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          If you do not return one or more Products that are part of a single order (other than Products that you
          purchase) after the date on which such Products must be returned or do not return the Product(s) at all (see
          the “Returns, Extensions, Shipping, and Lost Items” section below), you hereby authorize us (or our
          third-party payment processor) to charge your Payment Method a non-refundable late fee for every day that we
          do not receive every Product that comprises such order, up to an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
          the The Mercer Club’s purchase value of the Products not returned to us (for each Product, the “Retail Value”)
          plus applicable sales tax. The late fee is payable on a per-order, not a per-Product, basis. If you have not
          returned a Product within twenty (20) days after the specified return date for such Product, your late return
          will be considered a non-return and you hereby authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge
          your Payment Method the Retail Value of the Product, minus any late fees that you have already paid, plus
          applicable sales tax. Please see our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section for the current amount we charge for a late
          fee.<br />If you are charged by The Mercer Club for the full Retail Value of a Product pursuant to this “Late
          Fees” section, you are permitted to retain the Product; however, we do not make, and expressly disclaim, any
          warranties of any kind with respect to the Product, and the Product is provided to you on an “AS IS” basis.
          For the avoidance of doubt, this “Late Fees” section shall not apply to the Rental Fee, or fees paid or
          payable by you for the non-return of Return Packaging (as defined below), each of which will be charged
          separately from, and in addition to, any late fees. Late fees will not apply to any Products ordered using the
          Membership Service, unless you Cancel the Membership Service. Payment of any late fees does not excuse your
          breach of these Terms and does not limit our rights or remedies hereunder.

          With the delivery of a Product, The Mercer Club will provide you with pre-paid, pre-addressed packaging that
          you can use to return the Product (“Return Packaging”), as well as instructions for returning the Product to
          The Mercer Club. You may not keep, sell, or transfer (other than to us) any The Mercer Club-branded garment
          bags, accessory bags, and accessory boxes (“The Mercer Club Packaging”) that we provide to you. If The Mercer
          Club Packaging is not returned prior to the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days after the return of the associated
          Product or (ii) the termination, cancellation, or expiration of your Account or Paid Services, you hereby

          When you place a rental order for a Product, you hereby authorize The Mercer Club to charge your payment card
          or other payment instrument (“Payment Method”) for the Rental Fee. You must ensure that at all times your
          Payment Method is valid and up-to-date. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and
          contact information to The Mercer Club and notifying The Mercer Club of any changes to such information. The
          Mercer Club will charge your Payment Method the amount of the Rental Fee immediately upon your rental order. A
          reservation of a Product through the Services is an order for the rental of that Product, regardless of how
          far in advance that Product is reserved. In addition, at the time of your rental order for a Product, you
          hereby authorize The Mercer Club to charge your Payment Method for an amount up to the Retail Value of the
          Product set forth on the applicable Service plus applicable sales taxes; provided that The Mercer Club will
          only charge your Payment Method for an amount that is greater than the Rental Fee as described below and in
          the Cost of Services section above. Rental Fees exclude all federal, state, and local taxes, goods and service
          tax, fees, customs, duties, levies, and other governmental assessments, all of which shall be paid by you
          directly or, if paid by The Mercer Club, shall be paid by you to The Mercer Club in connection with your
          rental order.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you
          for any Paid Services through a payment account linked to your account (your “Billing Account”). By choosing
          to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in
          effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize
          us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen Payment Method. You agree to make payment using that
          selected Payment Method, but if the Payment Processor is not able to charge your preferred Payment Method, you
          authorize us to use any Payment Method stored on record for your Billing Account. We reserve the right to
          suspend or cancel a rental order or terminate your access to the Services in the event that we are unable to
          successfully charge the provided Payment Method. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor,
          and we reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that we or the Payment Processor make(s) even if we
          have or our Payment Processor has already requested or received payment. If we, through the Payment Processor,
          do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon
          demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          unauthorized disclosure or use of your User ID or password, you must promptly notify us and update your

          If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due
          to the imposition or change in the amount of state taxes), we shall provide notice of the amount to be charged
          and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your
          payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges
          incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each Billing Period.<br />Your
          non-termination or continued use of a Membership Service reaffirms that we (and/or our Payment Processor) are
          authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Membership Service. We may submit those charges for payment
          and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
          Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially
          selected to use the Membership Service.

          Some of the Paid Services are offered as a subscription that may consist of an initial period, for which there
          will be an initial charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you (“Membership Services”).
          If you choose a Membership Service, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current applicable rate
          (including all applicable taxes and fees) on the date that you sign up for such Membership Service. This date
          is your “Billing Date.” The applicable fee will automatically renew, meaning your Payment Method will be
          automatically charged the then-current applicable rate for the Membership Service during each subsequent month
          until you Pause or Cancel (each as defined below) the Membership Service or terminate your
          Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring charges will occur on a going-forward basis each month on or about the same date
          as your Billing Date (however, if your Billing Date does not exist in a given month, you will be billed on or
          around the last day of that month). The period between your Billing Dates is referred to as a “Billing
          Period.” As of your first Billing Date, the Membership Services are available to you, subject to these Terms.
          Your Account will remain active and you will remain eligible to participate in the Membership Services for
          subsequent Billing Periods after we successfully receive your payment for each applicable Billing Date. If you
          do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must Cancel or Pause the applicable
          Membership Service or terminate your Account before the end of the then-current Billing Period.<br />By
          choosing a recurring Membership Service, you acknowledge that such Paid Services have an initial and recurring
          payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT
          PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE
          (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR CANCELLED OR PAUSED THE
          SERVICES OR YOUR ACCOUNT. Such notice will not affect charges that have already been submitted or are in
          process. <br />To change your Payment Method, go to your&nbsp;&nbsp;account settings. To delete a Payment
          Method or terminate your payment authorization, contact us at support@themercerclubnyc.com or 954-787-0304.

          Periods (a “Pause”). If you wish to Pause your Membership Service, you must return each Product still in your

          do not return each Product in your possession prior to your next Billing Date, your Membership Service will
          not be Paused and you will continue to be charged for the Membership Service. Once Paused, we will provide
          notice to you on or before the date that your Membership Service reactivates. You can reactivate your
          Membership Service during a Pause at any time prior to the set date of reactivation, and that the date on

          herein as the “Arbitration Agreement”) because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
          The Mercer Club and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from The Mercer Club. Both you and The
          Mercer Club acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the
          subject matter of these Terms, The Mercer Club&#39;s officers, directors, employees, and independent
          contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these
          Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms
          against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

        <div class="x-arbitration-ru-od-faith-negoti-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          • Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to
          settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these
          Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating
          arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, such dispute shall be finally settled by binding
          arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will proceed in the English
          language, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as
          amended by this Arbitration Agreement (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
          substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The Consumer
          Arbitration Rules are available online
          at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web_FINAL_2.pdf. The arbitrator will
          conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless
          the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person
          appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration
          of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
          location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will
          follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
          temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this
          Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the
          arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from
          bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek
          relief against us for you. <br />• Class Action Waiver. You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will
          take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing
          to give up the ability to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
          Arbitration Agreement or any other provision of these Terms or in the American Arbitration Association’s
          Consumer Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the foregoing
          class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
          In any case in which (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (ii) there
          is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the
          class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of
          competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in
          arbitration.<br />• Small Claims Court; Infringement. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to resolve
          disputes using arbitration, both you and The Mercer Club may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims
          court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, both you
          and The Mercer Club will have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any
          court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
          violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
          rights.<br />• Waiver of Jury Trial. You and The Mercer Club are each waiving the right to trial by a jury and
          instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Except for disputes that qualify for
          small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship
          between you and The Mercer Club, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any
          other legal theory, will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided above
          regarding the class action waiver, such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or
          relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability,
          revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such
          matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set forth above, the
          preceding arbitration requirement shall not apply to disputes to the extent relating to the interpretation or
          application of the class action waiver above, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity. <br />•
          Exclusive Venue. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits either you or The
          Mercer Club to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court,
          then the foregoing Arbitration Agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and The Mercer Club
          agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal
          courts located in New York County, New York.<br />• Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and
          other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the
          preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This Arbitration Agreement
          will survive the termination of your relationship with The Mercer Club.

          As noted above, you must be 13 years or older to access or use the Services. To use the Services, you may be
          required to sign up for an account (your “Account”), select a password and username (your “The Mercer Club
          User ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your contact information. You promise to
          provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information, and to maintain and update such information.
          You may not select as your The Mercer Club User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another
          person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. We may reject, or require that you change, any The
          Mercer Club User ID, password or other information that you provide to us in registering for an Account. You
          may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You may only register one
          Account per Paid Service (as defined below).<br />Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or
          features of the Services by using your account credentials from other services operated by third parties
          (each, a “Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Google and Facebook. By using the Services through a
          Third Party Account, you authorize us to access information from such Third Party Account for use in
          connection with the Services. <br />You may only use the Services and Products made available to you for your
          own personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a
          manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services or Products is prohibited by
          these Terms or any Additional Terms or applicable laws, then you are not authorized to use the Services or
          Products. You are solely responsible for any use by you of any Services or Products in violation of these
          Terms, any Additional Terms, or applicable law.<br />You may not share your Account (including your The Mercer
          Club User ID or password) with anyone, and you must protect the security of your Account (including your The
          Mercer Club User ID and password) and any other access tools or credentials. You’re solely responsible for any
          activity associated with your Account, including all charges incurred from use of the Services with your
          Account.<br />We may, for any reason, limit or restrict your access to or use of the Services, including, but
          not limited to, refusing to fulfill any order that you place with us or restricting orders placed under a
          single customer Account, payment card, or billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit, cancel,
          or prohibit any use of the Services for any reason in our sole discretion, including but not limited to
          availability and geographic concerns, or if we determine or suspect that you are using the Services for
          fraudulent or commercial purposes or for any other purposes in violation of these Terms or any Additional
          Terms.

        <div class="late-fees-C61RwL overpass-bold-black-20px">Late Fees</div>
        <div class="if-you-do-not-r-hipping-and-los-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          If you do not return one or more Products that are part of a single order (other than Products that you
          purchase) after the date on which such Products must be returned or do not return the Product(s) at all (see
          the “Returns, Extensions, Shipping, and Lost Items” section below), you hereby authorize us (or our
          third-party payment processor) to charge your Payment Method a non-refundable late fee for every day that we
          do not receive every Product that comprises such order, up to an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
          the The Mercer Club’s purchase value of the Products not returned to us (for each Product, the “Retail Value”)
          plus applicable sales tax. The late fee is payable on a per-order, not a per-Product, basis. If you have not
          returned a Product within twenty (20) days after the specified return date for such Product, your late return
          will be considered a non-return and you hereby authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge
          your Payment Method the Retail Value of the Product, minus any late fees that you have already paid, plus
          applicable sales tax. Please see our&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQ Section for the current amount we charge for a late
          fee.<br />If you are charged by The Mercer Club for the full Retail Value of a Product pursuant to this “Late
          Fees” section, you are permitted to retain the Product; however, we do not make, and expressly disclaim, any
          warranties of any kind with respect to the Product, and the Product is provided to you on an “AS IS” basis.
          For the avoidance of doubt, this “Late Fees” section shall not apply to the Rental Fee, or fees paid or
          payable by you for the non-return of Return Packaging (as defined below), each of which will be charged
          separately from, and in addition to, any late fees. Late fees will not apply to any Products ordered using the
          Membership Service, unless you Cancel the Membership Service. Payment of any late fees does not excuse your
          breach of these Terms and does not limit our rights or remedies hereunder.

          applicable subscription rate (including all applicable taxes and fees) listed on the Membership Service on the
          date that you sign up for such Membership Service; provided that, if your Membership Service is based on a
          promotional rate, you will be charged a fee equal to the promotional rate for the duration of the promotion,
          and, after the expiration of the applicable promotion, you will be charged the applicable rate on a recurring
          monthly basis. For information on the applicable fees, including any applicable discounts and insurance

          The Mercer Club. You may not keep, sell, or transfer (other than to us) any The Mercer Club-branded garment

          the Products for any reason (other than normal wear and tear), including due to theft, loss, mysterious
          disappearance, fire, major stains, or any other cause. Normal wear and tear means minor stains, rips, missing
          beads, stuck zippers, or other minor damage that is covered by the insurance you paid for with your rental of
          the applicable Product. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you hereby

          applicable to that Product for the period of time of the extension. We are not responsible for any personal or

          believe you have accidentally or otherwise sent any such items to us, please contact customer service as soon
          as possible at support@themercerclubnyc.com. We may, but are not required to, assist you in attempting to
          locate such items at your request, and we assume no responsibility or liability if we attempt to locate such
          items.<br />If you use the Return Packaging that we provide, you must use the shipping carrier specified on

          loss, theft, or damage to Products that are shipped back to us using any carrier other than the carrier that
          is specified on our Return Packaging, or for any fees or expenses that you incur due to delays in The Mercer
          Club receiving the Product. The Mercer Club does not ship Products outside of the United States, and you may
          not return Products to us from outside of the United States without our prior written permission.<br />In the
          event that you lose or damage the Return Packaging that we provide, you will be responsible for returning the
          Product to us in your own packaging, at your own expense. Furthermore, you acknowledge that using any
          packaging or shipping carriers other than our Return Packaging and the carrier specified thereon may result in
          delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which The Mercer Club will not be liable. You will be solely
          liable for all such delays and additional delivery fees.<br />If you are returning a Product using our
          self-service kiosks, once a Product has been scanned into a kiosk return scanner, it is considered a Product
          return and you must immediately deposit the Product in the return bin provided. Failure to deposit a Product
          in the return bin at the self-service kiosk at the time that it is scanned into the kiosk is a violation of
          our Terms, and we may terminate your Account, charge your Payment Method for the full Value of the Product,
          and/or take other legal action.<br />For more information regarding Product returns, please refer to

          reservation of a Product through the Services is an order for the rental of that Product, regardless of how
          far in advance that Product is reserved. In addition, at the time of your rental order for a Product, you
          hereby authorize The Mercer Club to charge your Payment Method for an amount up to the Retail Value of the
          Product set forth on the applicable Service plus applicable sales taxes; provided that The Mercer Club will
          only charge your Payment Method for an amount that is greater than the Rental Fee as described below and in
          the Cost of Services section above. Rental Fees exclude all federal, state, and local taxes, goods and service
          tax, fees, customs, duties, levies, and other governmental assessments, all of which shall be paid by you
          directly or, if paid by The Mercer Club, shall be paid by you to The Mercer Club in connection with your
          rental order.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you
          for any Paid Services through a payment account linked to your account (your “Billing Account”). By choosing
          to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in
          effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize
          us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen Payment Method. You agree to make payment using that
          selected Payment Method, but if the Payment Processor is not able to charge your preferred Payment Method, you
          authorize us to use any Payment Method stored on record for your Billing Account. We reserve the right to
          suspend or cancel a rental order or terminate your access to the Services in the event that we are unable to
          successfully charge the provided Payment Method. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor,
          and we reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that we or the Payment Processor make(s) even if we
          have or our Payment Processor has already requested or received payment. If we, through the Payment Processor,
          do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon
          demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <div class="some-of-the-pai-bership-service-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          Some of the Paid Services are offered as a subscription that may consist of an initial period, for which there
          will be an initial charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you (“Membership Services”).
          If you choose a Membership Service, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current applicable rate
          (including all applicable taxes and fees) on the date that you sign up for such Membership Service. This date
          is your “Billing Date.” The applicable fee will automatically renew, meaning your Payment Method will be
          automatically charged the then-current applicable rate for the Membership Service during each subsequent month
          until you Pause or Cancel (each as defined below) the Membership Service or terminate your
          Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring charges will occur on a going-forward basis each month on or about the same date
          as your Billing Date (however, if your Billing Date does not exist in a given month, you will be billed on or
          around the last day of that month). The period between your Billing Dates is referred to as a “Billing
          Period.” As of your first Billing Date, the Membership Services are available to you, subject to these Terms.
          Your Account will remain active and you will remain eligible to participate in the Membership Services for
          subsequent Billing Periods after we successfully receive your payment for each applicable Billing Date. If you
          do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must Cancel or Pause the applicable
          Membership Service or terminate your Account before the end of the then-current Billing Period.<br />By
          choosing a recurring Membership Service, you acknowledge that such Paid Services have an initial and recurring
          payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT
          PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE
          (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR CANCELLED OR PAUSED THE
          SERVICES OR YOUR ACCOUNT. Such notice will not affect charges that have already been submitted or are in
          process. <br />To change your Payment Method, go to your&nbsp;&nbsp;account settings. To delete a Payment
          Method or terminate your payment authorization, contact us at support@themercerclubnyc.com or 954-787-0304.
          For information on how to Pause or Cancel your account, see below.

          If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due
          to the imposition or change in the amount of state taxes), we shall provide notice of the amount to be charged
          and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your
          payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges
          incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each Billing Period.<br />Your
          non-termination or continued use of a Membership Service reaffirms that we (and/or our Payment Processor) are
          authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Membership Service. We may submit those charges for payment
          and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
          Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially
          selected to use the Membership Service.

          We may, but are not obligated to, permit you to put your Membership Service on hold for one or more Billing
          Periods (a “Pause”). If you wish to Pause your Membership Service, you must return each Product still in your
          possession by your next Billing Date, in accordance with these Terms, for the Pause to go into effect. If you
          do not return each Product in your possession prior to your next Billing Date, your Membership Service will
          not be Paused and you will continue to be charged for the Membership Service. Once Paused, we will provide
          notice to you on or before the date that your Membership Service reactivates. You can reactivate your
          Membership Service during a Pause at any time prior to the set date of reactivation, and that the date on
          which you manually reactivate your Membership Service will become your new Billing Date. Please see

          • Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to
          settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these
          Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating
          arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, such dispute shall be finally settled by binding
          arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will proceed in the English
          language, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as
          amended by this Arbitration Agreement (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
          substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The Consumer
          Arbitration Rules are available online
          at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web_FINAL_2.pdf. The arbitrator will
          conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless
          the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person
          appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration
          of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
          location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will
          follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
          temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this
          Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the
          arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from
          bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek
          relief against us for you. <br />• Class Action Waiver. You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will
          take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing
          to give up the ability to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
          Arbitration Agreement or any other provision of these Terms or in the American Arbitration Association’s
          Consumer Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the foregoing
          class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
          In any case in which (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (ii) there
          is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the
          class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of
          competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in
          arbitration.<br />• Small Claims Court; Infringement. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to resolve
          disputes using arbitration, both you and The Mercer Club may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims
          court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, both you
          and The Mercer Club will have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any
          court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
          violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
          rights.<br />• Waiver of Jury Trial. You and The Mercer Club are each waiving the right to trial by a jury and
          instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Except for disputes that qualify for
          small claims court, all disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or any aspect of the relationship
          between you and The Mercer Club, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any
          other legal theory, will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided above
          regarding the class action waiver, such disputes include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or
          relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability,
          revocability or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such
          matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set forth above, the
          preceding arbitration requirement shall not apply to disputes to the extent relating to the interpretation or
