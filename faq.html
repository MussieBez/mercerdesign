                  Once you&#39;re a member, you will be prompted to choose items
                  for your first month&#39;s shipment. <br />On your dashboard
                  you will find delivery date information that will tell you how
                  quickly your shipment is estimated to arrive (we will also
                  send you an email with the tracking information of your
                  order.) Once you&#39;ve found your delivery date, think about
                  your calendar for work or personal events and the upcoming
                  weather. <br />Next, come up with some ideas about the type of
                  styles you&#39;d like to add to your shipment. We update our
                  inventory every month so you can browse &#34;&#34;New
                  Arrivals&#34;&#34; to see the most recently added inventory
                  available.<br />When you see something you love, heart it!
                  This will help you keep a running list of favorites when
                  it&#39;s time to pick your shipments. Hearting also helps your
                  closet learn your style preferences. Over time, your closet
                  adapts to what you heart and rent will give you up to date

                  How are items cleaned, including to prevent to the spread of

                </h3>
                <p class="textDescription">
                  All of our garments, accessories, hangers, and reusable
                  packaging are cleaned extensively each time they are returned
                  to us. <br />Our cleaning agents and practices are designed to
                  kill viruses such as the common cold and flu.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
                  on current guidance, we have no reason to believe that our
                  processes are ineffective against COVID-19.<br />The teams in
                  our fulfillment centers use a variety of techniques to ensure
                  that each garment is thoroughly cleaned, steamed and pressed,
                  inspected for quality, and carefully packaged so that it
                  arrives ready to wear. All garments go through a wet or dry
                  cleaning process. They also go through an additional screening
                  process by our staff which still go through our standard
                  cleaning processes. According to the CDC, flu viruses are
                  killed by heat above 167°F. Every garment is then enclosed in
                  bags for protection and cleanliness, which we ask customers to
                  return for recycling.
