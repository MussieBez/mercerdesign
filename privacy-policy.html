          “Personal Information,” as used in this Privacy Policy, is information that directly identifies an individual,
          such as a person’s name, or information that reasonably allows an individual to be identified indirectly, such
          as email or home address or a person’s mobile phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Information also includes
          information that is directly combined with such identifying information.<br /><br />Most of the Personal
          Information we collect is from our customers. This information falls into two (2) general categories:
          <br /><br />Passive Data Collection. This refers to data automatically collected from customers when they
          visit the Website or use the Services.<br /><br />User-Submitted Information. This refers to information that
          customers actively submit to us, which may be provided voluntarily or as required to use our Services.

        <div class="customers-also-nts-name-and-em-C61RwL overpass-normal-gravel-15px">
          Customers also sometimes provide us with information about other individuals, such as when a customer sends a
          gift card or uses our referral services to tell a friend about us. In those cases, we may ask that customer to
          provide the recipient’s name and email address. (We may also collect Personal Information in any personalized
          message that is submitted with a gift card or referral.) We will automatically send the recipient email
          correspondence with the gift card or referral, and invite them to visit the Website or otherwise use the
          Services. If we receive Personal Information for a referral or gift card, we use that information for the sole
          purpose of sending this email correspondence, and for tracking the use of the gift card or the success of our
          referral program.

          Customers also sometimes provide us with information about other individuals, such as when a customer sends a
          gift card or uses our referral services to tell a friend about us. In those cases, we may ask that customer to

          message that is submitted with a gift card or referral.) We will automatically send the recipient email

          Services. If we receive Personal Information for a referral or gift card, we use that information for the sole
          purpose of sending this email correspondence, and for tracking the use of the gift card or the success of our

          gift card or uses our referral services to tell a friend about us. In those cases, we may ask that customer to
